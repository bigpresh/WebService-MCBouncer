DESCRIPTION
    MCBouncer is a service allowing Minecraft server administrators to share
    details of bans and notes about abusive users.

    MCBouncer provides a server mod to use with the service, but also
    provides an API to query for bans / notes using an API key, obtained
    when you add a server to the list via the website.

    This module uses the API to allow you to fetch details of bans or notes
    about users.
